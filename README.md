Project Description:

ShareSphere is a platform that bridges the gap between those who want to help and those in need. It provides four main options for users: volunteering, donating items, purchasing from donations, and offering financial support. The financial contributions are distributed accordingly to meet the needs of those requiring assistance. This initiative aims to simplify and streamline the process of giving and receiving help.

The Problem Statement:

There is a significant gap between people who want to help and those who need assistance. Many individuals are willing to contribute, but due to the lack of a proper system, their efforts do not always reach the right people. Our goal is to bridge this gap effectively.

The Solution:

Our solution is ShareSphere, a website designed to connect helpers with those in need. By providing an easy-to-use platform, we ensure that donations, volunteer opportunities, and financial contributions reach the intended recipients efficiently.
